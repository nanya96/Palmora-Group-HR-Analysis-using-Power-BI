# Palmora-Group-HR-Analysis Using Power BI
### Project Overview
This project analyses the company's data (Palmora-Group-HR data) to uncover possible issues and patterns, providing actionable insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address for strategic planning. It focuses more on resolving issues like gender inequality within the organization and its region, and creating meaningful visualizations for the management team.


### Objectives
- What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments.
- Show insights on ratings based on gender
- Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
- A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
    - Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
    - Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?
    - Also visualize this by regions.
- Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees.
- Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus).
- Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide.
